✅ Integration Of LLM With Discord Part 1 | This would involve connecting the LLM to the Discord API, allowing it to be used on multiple Discord servers within the Cardano and SingularityNET ecosystem. | The ability to [install bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1091605083621441606&permissions=85056&scope=applications.commands%20bot) into Discord shows the bot is ready to be integrated between the Discord (i.e. user interface) and the backend (LLM, database, services). [[source](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh.ai.chat/blob/main/src/lib/discord/index.ts)]
✅ Build Data Pipeline At Backend | Chat messages deem as potential training data are collected and organized. | On Discord, users can reply to bot's message and flag using emojis, which is then collected and organized into the database for training. [[source](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh.ai.chat/tree/main/src/lib/supabase)]
✅ Build ML Ops Pipeline Part 1 | From data to training data to model training. | We leverage on Google to gather more data, user inputs from interactions, and OpenAI to train the model. [[source](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh.ai.chat/blob/main/src/lib/discord/events/MessageReactionAdd.ts)]
✅ Training The Model | The LLM would need to be trained on Cardano and SingularityNET-related topics using data from Discord chats. This would involve collecting and pre-processing the data, and then using it to train the model. Note that this is ongoing process and this work will last as long as the service is up. | As users feedback are collected, we can use the data to fine-tune the responses, thus providing the most updated answers. [[source](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh.ai.chat/blob/main/src/lib/discord/commands/train.ts) [source](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh.ai.chat/blob/main/src/lib/google/index.ts) [source](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh.ai.chat/tree/main/src/lib/supabase)]
✅ Build ML Ops Pipeline Part 2 | From model training to response serving. | This is most evident when users interact with the bot, by simply typing `/ask` and the bot will reply with the most relevant answer. [[source](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh.ai.chat/blob/main/src/lib/openai/createCompletion.ts) [source](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh.ai.chat/blob/main/src/lib/discord/commands/ask.ts)]
✅ Integration Of ChatGPT With Discord Part 2 | For serving responses and collecting data feedback. | With the collected data in database, we can use those feedbacks to response to users' questions with the latest information, and later feed all data into model for training. [[source](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh.ai.chat/blob/main/src/lib/discord/commands/ask.ts) [source](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh.ai.chat/blob/main/src/lib/discord/commands/train.ts)]
✅ Testing And Debugging | The integration would need to be thoroughly tested and any bugs or issues would need to be identified and fixed. Note that this is ongoing process and this work will last as long as the service is up. | We have installed the bot in multiple Discord servers, and users are interacting with the bot. The system has been running smoothly since May 2023.
✅ Deployment | Once the integration has been tested and debugged, it can be deployed to the Discord servers where it will be used. | The bot has been deployed in multiple Discord servers. [Install bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1091605083621441606&permissions=85056&scope=applications.commands%20bot).
✅ User Documentation And Training | Detailed documentation and user guides would need to be created to help community members understand how to use the service, and training would need to be provided to help community members get the most out of the service. | We have created a [user guide](https://ai.meshjs.dev/).
Maintenance And Support | After the service is launched, it will need to be maintained and supported to ensure that it continues to function properly and to address any issues that arise. | System has been running smoothly since May 2023.
Monitor And Measure Performance | Regular monitoring of the service performance and usage is important to measure the success of the service and make any necessary adjustments. | System has been running smoothly since May 2023.
